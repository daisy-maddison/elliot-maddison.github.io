Doodles
</h2> </i>

<p>
<h3 id="title"> Doodles is a multiplayer drawing game where one to four players select a theme and must draw a randomly generated phrase before the time runs out. 
<br>
Doodles is feature complete, but still requires more bug fixing to be truly complete.
<br>
I am the sole programmer of this game, but worked with an artist/designer to create this.

Supernova Scuttle
</h2> </i>

<h3 id="title"> Supernova Scuttle is a 2D endless runner where you take control of a spaceship and fly between three lanes, aiming to get as far as possible, by dodging incoming obstacles and collecting powerups.
<br>
Supernova Scuttle is entirely programmed by myself. I also created the art for the customisable backgrounds and killzones. </h3>

Shudu Showdown
</h2> </i>

<h3 id="title"> Shudu Showdown is a one or two player 2D side scrolling beat 'em up where you take on the role of the character MC. You fight through multiple levels, each progressing the story, and defeat numerous bosses. 
<br>
I am currently the sole developer of Shudu Showdown, and everything in the demo level - with the exception of the music - was created by myself, including the placeholder art and story.</h3>

Another Guess Who Game
</h2> </i>

<h3 id="title"> Another Guess Who Game is a shorter version of the standard Guess Who game, where players take turns asking questions to narrow down a collection of faces until they guess who their opponent is thinking of. My version of the game supports a singleplayer mode, where one player competes against the computer, a local multiplayer mode, where two players duel on the same screen, and an online mode, where two players communicate via a text chat room. 
<br>
Everything in this game was created by me.</h3>
